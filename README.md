# Poppular Movies - Stage 1

This app works with the themoviedb.org API to show a list of poppular and top-rated movies.

To use it, you will need to have an IMDB account, If you donâ€™t already have it, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.

Please see: https://www.themoviedb.org/?_dc=1502574255



Once you have the API Key, replace it on NetworkUtils class in the project.

Have fun!
